Exercise: Counting occurrences and parsing
==========================================

Description
-----------

Write a program that will read a text file and parse data from it.

Each line of file can contain up to four pairs of numbers and words, with
each pair separated from the next by a comma. The number in a pair represents
a quantity. The word is the name of a fruit flavor.

Each line will have at least one data pair and at most four data pairs.

This is what a data file might look like:

    1 apple, 3 orange
    11 orange, 24 apple, 15 banana, 40 grape
    5 grape, 6 strawberry, 9 mango
    1 mango
    18 banana, 7 grape, 4 orange

Given the above data, the program should generate the following output:

1. List of flavors and total quantities, in descending order of quantity
2. List of flavors and total quantities, in ascending order of quantity
3. Flavors in alphabetical order and their corresponding total quantities
